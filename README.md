# MQTT subscriber

A service to listen for messages and save the data.

# Installation

There is a Bash script to install this service: [`install.sh`](install.sh).
There are further details below.

## Install Python package

Create a virtual environment

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/balance-subscriber
sudo python3 -m venv /opt/balance-subscriber/venv
```

Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source /opt/balance-subscriber/venv/bin/activate
```

Install this package

```bash
pip install --upgrade balance-subscriber
```

## Set up service

Create a service account called `balance-subscriber`.

```bash
sudo useradd --system balance-subscriber
```

This user must have permissions to write to the target data directory.

Install the [systemd](https://systemd.io/) service.

```bash
cp --verbose ./systemd/balance-subscriber.service /etc/systemd/system/balance-subscriber.service
```

Reload all systemd unit files

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Enable the service

```bash
sudo systemctl enable balance-subscriber.service
```

# Configuration

Configure the service using the systemd configuration editor.

```bash
sudo systemctl edit balance-subscriber.service
```

This will create or edit an override configuration file in the directory `/etc/systemd/system/balance-subscriber.service.d`.
Edit this file to set the options for the service, such as the target data directory. Each row defines an environment variable containing a configuration setting for the service.

```unit file (systemd)
[Service]
Environment="DATA_DIR=/tmp"
```

Then, restart the service as described in the service control section.
